# Udacity FSND P0: Movie Trailer Website

This is a movie trailer website created as a part of project submission for
**Full Stack Nanodegree** by **Udacity**.

## Technologies used:

* Python 2.7
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

## Running site

Run `freshtomatoes.py` file using command:
'''
python freshtomatoes.py
'''

This loops over all the movie data present in `entertainmet_center.py` and creates a new **html**
file - `fresh_tomatoes.html`.

Generated `html` file lists all the movies along with Title, Poster image and shows YouTube trailer
when clicked on box art.
